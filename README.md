# Entrust Identity Verification SDK for iOS

The **Entrust Identity Verification SDK for iOS** (formerly the Onfido iOS Smart Capture SDK) provides a set of screens and modules that enable applications to implement user identity verification flows.

The Entrust Identity Verification SDKs introduce a fundamental redesign of the customer integration experience and configuration capabilities, including dynamic verification module selection and real-time module loading from Entrust’s CDN.
